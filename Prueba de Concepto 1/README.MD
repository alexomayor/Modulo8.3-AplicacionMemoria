I used the Durstenfeld shuffle, where in each iteration the last value is swapped with a random value from 0 to last value (remaining cards not yet chosen to be shuffled).
This function would modify the original array, so there is no need to return a new array. When calling this function, the argument would be the array cardDeck, type GameCards.

Type GameCards is set as an array with 12 values.
Variable cardDeck declares string values from A to L.
